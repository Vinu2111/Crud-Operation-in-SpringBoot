CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that are performed on persistent storage. In the context of Spring Boot, CRUD operations are typically performed on a database.
Spring Boot provides a number of features that make it easy to perform CRUD operations. One of these features is the Spring Data JPA project. Spring Data JPA provides a number of interfaces that can be used to perform CRUD operations on a database.
Another feature that Spring Boot provides is the Spring MVC project. Spring MVC provides a number of annotations that can be used to create controllers that handle HTTP requests. These controllers can then be used to perform CRUD operations on a database.
